Queue.py - Queue class
SubBlock.py - SubBlock class
scheduler.cgi - Web python cgi script (hosted in Sutherland)
scheduler_noncgi.py - command line version

Software notes:
-scheduler.cgi has python pointing to the install on web.salt.saao.ac.za
-scheduler_noncgi.py has python pointing to /opt/local/bin/python2.7 (as on my desktop machine in the office)
-sdb.saao is to be used for any of this software run from Cape Town. If in Sutherland, sdb.salt
-Passwords are omitted from the files.
-It's also possible to get scheduler.cgi running on a local webserver. In which case also make sure sdb.saao is used.
